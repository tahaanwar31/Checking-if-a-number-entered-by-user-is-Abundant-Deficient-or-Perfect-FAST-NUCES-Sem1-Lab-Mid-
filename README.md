# Checking-if-a-number-entered-by-user-is-Abundant-Deficient-or-Perfect-FAST-NUCES-Sem1-Lab-Mid-


This program determines whether a given positive integer is abundant, deficient, or perfect by calculating its divisors and their sum. After prompting the user for a valid positive number, it computes all divisors (excluding the number itself) and classifies the number based on the sum of these divisors. If the sum exceeds the number, it is classified as abundant; if less, it is deficient; and if equal, it is perfect. The code was tested in the 1st semester lab of the Programming Fundamentals course at FAST NUCES.
